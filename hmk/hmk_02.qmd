## Homework 2

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
a <- 2 
b <- 4 
a > b 
ls() 
rm(list=ls()) 
ls()
```

## Question 4: Why does rm(list=ls()) work?

-   **(rm)** will remove the objects from the specified environment
-   **list** is the argument in the rm function that provides the specific location where the objects are that are to be removed
-   **ls()** is a function that will list the objects that are in the environment that we want to be removed
-   in the end, our global environment will be empty.

## Search Function

We can use this to search a number of different options and packages that are in base R.

```{r}
search()
```
